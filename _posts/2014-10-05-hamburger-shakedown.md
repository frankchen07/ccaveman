**Feast.** Double Hamburger.

Yes. Everyone wants to know. "How does the Shake Shack burger compare to In and Out? East versus West? Who's the best?"

I'll go into a definitive answer right now. We begin.

**The bun:**  
**In and out:** Plump, soft, warm. Matte finish. If you're lucky it'll sometimes look like it's been brushed with oil. Nice, yeasty finish (which most likely helped it rise?)  
**Shake shack:** A bit deflated. Soft, not as warm. Matte finish. Not enough yeast?  
**Win:** In and Out.  
**Science:** Toasting it can prevent sogginess.  

**Lettuce/tomato/pickles/mustard/ketchup:**  
**Win:** If you mess this up...really? Pretty much the same. In and Out's tomatoes are slightly thicker, more watery, and doesn't taste very tomato-y.  
**Technical win:** Shake Shack.  
**Science:** Mealy tomatoes can be a result of not taking care of your tomato plant. Bad watering cycles and too much nitrogen in the soil can lead to mushy sadness.  

**Meat:**  
**In and Out:** Flat, a bit textureless. A bit anemic looking. Dry.  
**Shake shack:** A bit more plump, more textured. Slightly anemic looking. Not dry, nicely seasoned. Just a bitttt pink. Lovely.  
**Win:** Shake Shack.  
**Tweak:** Grind your own meat. It'll be a steak in burger format. Also, you won't get mysteryÂ meat.  

**Sauce:**  
**In and Out:** Relish-y, mayo-ey, nicely balanced, makes the burger.  
**Shake Shack:** Can't remember it very well. Forgettable?  
**Win:** In and Out.  
**Tip:** If you mix all the sauces a restaurant provides you (like getting all the sodas at the fountain), you *might* end up with In-and-Out's sauce. *Maybe.*

Well, looks like a tie.

**Tiebreaker:**  
**User:** Frank  
**Origin:** West Coast  
**Technical win: In and Out.**  

That's settled...I guess I'm a bit biased.
