My sister coined the term, "Are you gastronomically bored?" to indicate times at which absolutely NOTHING sounds appetizing. I'm here today to disprove that notion. After all, you gotta eat, yeah? WE BEGIN.

So remember (you probably don't) back in statistics/probability/calculus (*glazed over eyes*, *zzz*) how to calculate the number of possible combinations? If you had 2 types of cones and 2 types of ice cream and 3 types of toppings, how many variations of an ice cream cone could you get? 2 x 2 x 3...that's 12 possibilities. More than you can eat in a day. Okay maybe not. You can eat that in a day, but you'll probably be diabetic afterwards. It's k. The way I learned and remembered that simple mathematical calculation was by saying, there's "two by two by three choices." Multiplication in probability usually meant "and", and addition usually meant "or."

Okay enough with the math (I'm a foodie, not a mathematician). Possible combinations? Just multiply the choices together. Sheesh.
