Today, I learned I was previously spelling Brussels sprout(s) incorrectly. I was not aware of the ending s on Brussels, nor was I aware of the capitalization.

**Singular:** Brussels sprout.

**Plural:** Brussels sprouts.

**When used at the beginning of a sentence:** Brussels sprouts are extremely tricky in nomenclature.

**When used in the middle of a sentence:** My taste buds were seduced by those amazing Brussels sprouts.

I apologize for my poor English.
