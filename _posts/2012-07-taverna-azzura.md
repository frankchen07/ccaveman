[Taverna Azzura](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187782-d1082944-Reviews-Ristorante_Taverna_Azzurra-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html).

**Feast.** Shrimp cocktail. Assorted "raw" plate. Clam Pasta. Octopus Casserole. Crabmeat-stuffed Ravioli. Grilled...Fish (totally don't remember the name. But it was good. Tender).

This was a particularly rushed endeavor, as we literally had two hours (what would a figurative two hours be...?) when we touched down in Sorrento, get from high up in the hills alllll the way down to the coast...eat, and then stampede our way back up to the train station, and high-tail it back to Rome. Damn rushed for sure. The sleet rain didn't help either, nor did the traffic after the meal (there was an epic uphill hike through random neighborhoods, dodging torrenting waterfalls, since the taxi couldn't come get us). BUT, rewind.Â We got off the Sorrento train station, waved down a taxi, which took us to the entrance of Taverna Azzura, a coastal seafood restaurant that I found via Google, via crappy Wi-Fi, the night before.

Everything at Taverna Azzura was ridiculously fresh. They say seafood that's fresh should always smell like the sea. Considering half our meal was raw fish, I was able to tell that our meal was indeed fresh, as nothing smelled...fishy (can't conjure up a better explanation). However, we've all encountered that particularly fishy smell that occurs just after several days of sitting in the fridge (Surprise tip: place ice packs on top and bottom of the fish to lengthen its life in the fridge...or...eat it _right now_).

So what could be the cause of this, and how can you rescue the fish? (Not rescue in the way zombies reanimate...yeah, you know what I mean).

First, there's gotta be an understanding of some basic chemistry. (Don't worry, I won't make this too complicated).

Actually biology first, then chemistry.

Biology.

On a general level, fish, living in the ocean, are obviously in a different environment, compared to normal land mammals. In order to counteract the salty balance of the sea, fish (and other creatures, such as mollusks) fill their cells up with amines and other related amino acids. One of these amines is TMAO, or trimethylamine oxide. TMAO is the source of the fishy smell that occurs with seafood. When stored in the fridge, the bacteria and enzymes begin to convert TMAO to trimethylamine (TMA). Other fish do not contain TMAO, but rather, urea. Urea is not innocuous either, as it is converted to kitchen-grade ammonia, which obviously is not a pleasant smell.

Chemistry.

Nerds can geek out below with the reaction mechanisms. They're not super intricate or anything. But it'll suffice. Non-science folks? Follow me. I'll give the one minute breakdown, shown below. We start with TMAO. Chemistry is all about losing and gaining electrons. Oxidation is losing electrons, and reduction is gaining electrons. Each element can only hold on to a certain amount of electrons. Bonds (those lines in between the elements, such as N (nitrogen) C (carbon) or O (oxygen), also count as electrons (shared electrons, in this case (Figure 1)). Nucleophile (has extra electrons to give), grabs onto bacterial enzyme. Double bonds are likely to form on oxygen (Figure 2). Double bond formation will cause electron max to be reached on the oxygen. Subsequently, "electron pushing" (it's like musical chairs with electrons) breaks the bond between nitrogen and oxygen. TMAO turns to TMA, with an ultimate gain in electrons on the nitrogen. Reduction reaction. Odorous. Smelly. Fishy. Easy explanation? Electrons get pushed around. Bonds exchange, and TMAO turns to TMA. (Should've just started with that).

This is why we freeze our seafood. Not only does it inactivate surface bacteria, or even parasites contained within the delicate meat, it slows the enzymes within the meat, and the bacteria that come with it, so conversion from TMAO to TMA is slower. However, there are also other contributing factors to the fishes' ability to become smelly. Cold-water fishes rely on polyunsaturated fats (poly (multiple) unsaturated (not filled), which means more spaces in the fat structure, thus, more liquidy at colder temperatures, as the spaces inhibit proper alignment. Solids have proper alignment (nicely lined up molecules). Liquids do not. Oxidation (loss of electrons, remember?) of polyunsaturated fats, thus can yield off-smells...and flavors. Key to remember? Polyunsaturated fats are unstable!

**_Side note._** The bacteria described above that inhabits fish flesh also are acclimated to cold-water temperatures. They find our refrigerator temperatures...somewhat nice. You can almost imagine the bacteria going on vacation, setting up umbrellas and drinking mai tais on your fresh yellowtail. That's more than enough reason for me to eat my fish fresh, freeze it when the zombies come and attack, and to bring a cooler full of ice when I set up a blind date with my fishmonger.
