**Exploding lamb. Home-cooking.**

**Interesting intricacies of our beloved kitchen gadgets. Le microwave.**

So I was microwaving a lamb shank because I was hungry. Being naturally distracted 134.5% of the time, I left the microwave running for about two minutes, while I tried to find something to do for the two minutes, to feel productive.

It was about 30 seconds in when I heard "BOOM!" I was somewhat startled, and quickly shuffled back to the microwave, where I found this.

Caused by this.

And the blowback on the microwave.

And naturally, I shuffled nonchalantly back into my room to get my camera, instead of cleaning up.

**What happened?**

Microwaves vibrate water molecules which increases kinetic energy. Explosions like this are caused by an aqueous medium in a closed environment (a water pocket in the lamb). The pocket was positioned correctly under the flesh so that during the vibration process, water (and eventually steam), would be trapped in a closed volume (the molecules therefore, frantically bounce around, trying to find a way out)...until the protein strands can't hold it in any longer...and boom.

**Simple explanation, simple clean-up, and a subtle reminder that there's a bomb in every kitchen.**
