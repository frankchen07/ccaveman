**Foods for the Soul nominated me for the "inspiring blog" award. I'm super flattered. I didn't think much would result from my writings and drawings except some food poisoning and hate mail, so I'm deeply honored.**

Thanks!

[Link up](http://foodsforthesoul.wordpress.com/) with Foods for the Soul, a wonderful blog in its own right. The pictures alone will cause hunger pangs. I warned you beforehand. Get in your kitchen, and clean the dust out of your oven, cause you're gonna need it.

Apparently, there are rules for this kind of award.

**Rules:**

1. Display the award logo on your blog.
2. Link back to the person who nominated you.
3. State 7 things about yourself.
4. Nominate 15 other bloggers for the award and link to them.

**7 facts about myself:**

1. I'm a minimalist. (the next 6 facts could technically be absent...haha).
2. I'm actually a pretty quiet guy, until you get to know me. Then you can't get me to shut up. Then there's no going back. Sorry, chump.
3. The fastest shower I have ever taken was and is still approximately two minutes.
4. Hands down favorite band: Augustana.
5. I own and ride an orange bicycle with blue wheels. If you ever see me, say hello! And don't hit me. I also rock alot of stickers on my helmet.
6. I have an affinity for Suzanne Goin's restaurants in L.A. These include A.O.C, Lucques, The Tavern, and The Hungry Cat (which I have yet to go to).
7. Writing was actually my weakest skill back in middle/high school. I had private tutoring starting from 6th grade, for five-six-ish years...all I gotta say is, the more you read and more you write, the better you are; that being said, never stop seeking to become better, so...don't stop writing and reading.

**Om Nom-inations, in no particular order; this may total to be less than 15, as I don't think I follow 15 blogs just yet. (I guess more reason to do so now!)**

1. [Standing Ovation, Seated.](http://artmoscow.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/composition-and-meaning-a-short-lesson/)
2. [Tahoe Sux.](http://tahoesux.com/2012/11/25/the-madness-of-black-friday/)
3. [Sizzle Eats.](http://sizzleeats.com/)
4. [A Better Life with Burgers.](http://abetterlifewithburgers.blogspot.com/) (Not Wordpress).[
