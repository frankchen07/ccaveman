				<p><strong>Hualien pre- &amp; post-randomness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Feast.</strong> Egg-daikon cake (lúo buō gāo, 蘿蔔糕). Squid on a stick, Fried thousand year egg, Chinese burritos, meat jerky, and a hooligan vegetable farewell.</p>

<p>Quick rewind. Waiting around at the Zi Shan MRT station, ready to depart for Hualien.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were the remnants of a Lantern festival near Zi Shan which sported a mini-open-air market. Rock and I perused the eats, and took notice to squid on a stick as well as fried thousand year egg. Quite interesting. The grilled squid on a stick was marinated in the house “secret sauce” and continually basted and brushed until ready.</p>

    <figcaption>Ethereal.</figcaption>

<p>The thousand year egg, with it’s bluish-green translucence, was slightly off-putting, not only because of the sulfuric smell but because it looked (and smelled) rotten. Harold Mcgee quotes in his book, “On Food and Cooking,” that these eggs take on a <em>“decrepit appearance: the shell is encrusted with mud, the white a transparent, brown jelly, and the yolk a semisolid, somber jade…the flavor is eggy in the extreme, salty, stonily alkaline, with strong accents of sulfur and ammonia.”</em> Generally not too pleasant.</p>

    <figcaption>A great idea nonetheless.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Two things</strong> are required to make thousand year eggs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Salt.</li>
  <li>Something very alkaline (lye, sodium carbonate).</li>
</ol>

<p>Eggs too, of course.</p>

<p><strong>The process.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a paste or solution with the two non-egg ingredients above.</li>
  <li>Encase/submerge the eggs.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What goes on.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Salt disrupts protein structure.</li>
  <li>High alkalinity raises the egg’s pH level.</li>
  <li>An accumulation of negative charges causes charge repulsion and subsequently, protein denaturation.</li>
  <li>Proteins then bond together. We observe a “solid, yet transparent gel.”</li>
  <li>High alkalinity increases reactions between egg albumen and free glucose = brown egg white.</li>
  <li>Increased alkalinity degrades phospholipids/turns proteins into sulfides/ammonia produced= green eggs but no ham.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Jargon aside, someone apparently thought, “Hey. Let’s fry this stuff. I bet it tastes great.” They were right.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Fast forward.</strong></p>

<p>Our second day in Hualien involved a great deal of scootering south of where we were. Breakfast was again found within a kilometer from where we were staying. The original plan was actually to find the “deep fried scallion pancake” place (remember these locations don’t really have names; they’re known for what they sell). Only problem was that we couldn’t find the damn place. Super slow Google mapping and marching up and down the same street a couple times only revealed some dead-weedy-looking alleys, some “such amateur tourists” looks, and what seemed to be a nightclub that replaced the original restaurant. Oh well. We stepped next door to another breakfast place and ate our share of Taiwanese goodies. This time, the highlight was egg-daikon cake. I did a previous post about how turnip/daikon cake was made- the only difference this time around was that they added an omelette over it.</p>

<p>Riding the train from Hualien back to Taipei made me feel like I was train hopping, since we didn’t have assigned seats, so we ended up behind several rows of seats in front a train garbage can. This was the camping spot where we sat, sprawled out, just chillin’, chatting, being hooligans, and eating fern-like vegetables. Cool.</p>
